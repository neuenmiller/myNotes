\chapter{Solving Linear Equation \(Ax = b\)}
\section{Elimination and Back Substitution}
I fucked up

\section{Elimination Matrices and Inverse Matrices}
This too.

\section{Matrix Computation and \(A = LU\)}
This one too.

\section{Permutation and Tranposes}
Also this shit.

\section{Derivatives and Finite Difference Matrices}
Second difference matrices includes \(K, T, B\).
They all have the \(-1, 2, -1\) pattern.
Now we can approximate \(-\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} = f=(x)\)
