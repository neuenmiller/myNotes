myNotes

This is a live, modular LaTeX-based note-taking monorepo, written by
Kansapat Udomchokpaiboon, Hu Jinlin, Tham, Neuen, Frontier, whatever you know me as. Everything here is written during lectures or self-study sessions. No rewrites or polishing, this is a student's note.

Why this exists:

LaTeX notes are faster, cleaner, and more searchable than handwritten notes, and they also allow for more complexity and foolproofing than WYSIWYG notes.

This repo is heavily inspired by the great late [Gilles Castel's workflow](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/) and adapted to fit my own study system, including GitHub syncing, modular files, and a zero-overhead editing style.

Philosophy

Live-noting: Everything is typed during lectures or studies.
Modular Files: Each chapter has its own ".tex" file.
Fully Git-traced: All changes are versioned; notes evolve with understanding.
No Touch-ups: Again, this is a student's note, not a polished textbook.
Public: Useful for others; even if incomplete, even if messy.
